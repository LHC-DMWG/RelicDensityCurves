--- File contours_scan_mA_ma.root

        Scan of ma vs mA = mH = mHc with mDM = 10 GeV. 
        This is the nominal scan used in the DMWG whitepaper for studies of MonoH, MonoZ...
        (All parameters chosen accordingly.)

        x-axis: ma
        y-axis: mA=mHc


--- File contours_scan_mxd_ma.root
        Scan of mxd vs ma as shown in the relic section of the whitepaper.

        x-axis: ma (TeV)
        y-axis: mxd (TeV)


--- File contours_scan_mxd_ma_large.root
        Same as contours_scan_mxd_ma.root, except much larger axis range

        x-axis: ma (TeV)
        y-axis: mxd (TeV)

--- File contours_scan_mxd_tanbeta.root
        Scan of mxd vs tan(beta) as shown in the relic section.

        x-axis: mxd (GeV)
        y-axis: tanbeta

--- File contours_scan_ma_tanbeta.root
        Scan of ma vs tan(beta) as shown in the relic section.

        x-axis: ma
        y-axis: tanbeta
